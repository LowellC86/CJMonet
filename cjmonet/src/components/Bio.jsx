      <p>My work explores the relationship between words, music, art, and movement. A picture is worth a thousand words, but what if that picture could actually be a thousand words or more? My work has evolved over time from just painting and drawing to portraits made completely out of words.</p>
      <p>My background is not in studio art, but in art theory, art history, and neuroscience. I learned a lot about how art and music are perceived by people, both societally and biologically. My art is the madness to the method; my love for method is the routine to the madness found in the art I create.</p>
      <p>Above all, I create art to honor moments. Whether that is a feeling that I want to evoke in an abstract painting, or a legendary artist memorialized by the words that they singâ€”my art is found at the intersection of a moment and what makes the moment unique from another.</p>
